Stuff for when I'm bored
========================

Pack/Unpack

Check if there is enough space on the HDD
Check if there is a file in place of the file to create, ask user to overwrite, extra checkbox?


Pack

Check if accumulated data is > 1 GB
Check if accumulated files are above 5000

Misc

JDialogs for pack/unpack
Probably only works on Windows because of the path separator used in some places, test that

find a fix for the JFileChooser InterruptedException which is caused by a lingering bug in Swing, maybe immediate dereferencing does the trick, as well as forced gc?

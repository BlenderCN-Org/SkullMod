How to use SkullMod
=====================
A) I know command line arguments
Just start it with an open command line in the same
directory as SkullMod, type "SkullMod" and follow the instructions

B) Make it easy
Drag and drop the files you want to convert on the matching files
==>Want to unpack gfs files?
Drag them on "GFS unpack.bat"
The output directories are created in the same directory
==>Want to pack gfs files?
Note: "characters-art-pt.gfs" hast to be packed with "GFS pack aligned.bat"
SkullMod will tell you if you try to pack it unaligned.

Drag and drop directories on "GFS pack.bat"
A wild .gfs appears in the same directory.
What will you do?
FIGHT PKMN
ITEM RUN
==>Want to unpack dds files?
Drag them on "DDS unpack.bat"
Images may appear magically in the same directory
==>Want to unpack spr.msb files?
Make sure the .spr.msb  and the .dds file are both in the same directory
Drag .spr.msb files only on "SPR unpack.bat"
A directory will appear that contains all animations
Just open the .html files to view them
The frames of each animation are in a sub folder



What works?
.gfs unpacking, packing aligned and unaligned
.dds unpacking (DXT1 and 5)
.spr.msb unpacking
